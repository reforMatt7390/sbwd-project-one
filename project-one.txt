          <h2>Mathew's Background</h2>
          <p>
          I'm a transfer student, studying Computer Science here at Illinois Tech.  I took a break from
          college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants.  There, I gained professional
          experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event planning, balancing
          P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a multi-million dollar department
          at a first-class hospitality firm.  At my previous college, I held numerous positions including
          Service Chair, Fellowship Chair, and Vice President at an award-winning chapter of Phi Theta.
          I've also served as a leader inside the classroom as a Supplemental Instructor.  I have a unique
          combination of leadership and team experience in both academic and professional settings.

          <h2>Ambitions for this class</h2>
          <p>
          During COM 330, I hope to learn how to develop web pages (from scratch) that will be accessible on
          all devices.  Specific goals include:
            *develop a website to showcase my abilities (kinda like a resume)
              *being able to work on/optimize a website that has already been developed
          I'd also like to determine how much I like web design as a potential career option.  And of
          course, I aspire to earn an A!

          <h2>My Career at IIT and Beyond</h2>
          <p>
          For the last few months, I've represented students from the College of Science as a Senator for
          the Student Government Association.  There, I pioneered the Student Organization Accessibility
          Project.  Once completed, it will ensure that our student organizations are accessible to
          everyone, even students who come from low-income families and other underprivileged communities.
          I'm currently running for re-election, however, I've also been asked to represent IIT on a larger
          scale as an Ambassador to the Coalition of Chicago Colleges and Universities.  After completing my
          undergraduate studies at Illinois Tech, I hope to pursue a PhD in either Applied Mathematics,
          Computer Science, or a similar field.  My ultimate goal is to teach computer science and
          mathematics as a university professor.
