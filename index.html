          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a transfer student, studying Computer Science at Illinois Tech.  I took a break from
            college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants.  There, I gained
            professional experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event
            planning, balancing P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a
            multi-million dollar department at a first-class hospitality firm.  At my previous
            college, I held numerous positions including Service Chair, Fellowship Chair, and Vice
            President at an award-winning chapter of Phi Theta. I've also served as a leader inside
            the classroom as a Supplemental Instructor.  In my free time, I'm dog sitter with
            Rover.com.  One of my favorite clients, Jada, is a 9 year old American Pitbull who loves
            long walks, tummy rubs, and hanging out in front of Galvin Library!

          <h2>Ambitions for this class</h2>
          <p>
            During COM 330, I hope to learn how to develop web pages (from scratch) that will be
            accessible on all devices.  Specific goals include:
          <!-- must end </p> here, or the text after <ul> will NOT change color -->
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>develop a website to showcase my abilities (kinda like a resume)</li>
            <li>optimize a website that has already been developed (like the SGA website)</li>
            <li>learn some super-cool html and css techniques (like this bulleted list!)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          I also hope to determine how much I like web design as a potential career option.  And
          of course, I aspire to earn an A!

          <h2>Career at IIT and Beyond</h2>
          <p>
            For the last few months, I've represented students from the College of Science as a
            Senator for the Student Government Association.  There, I pioneered the Student
            Organization Accessibility Project.  Once completed, it will ensure that our student
            organizations are accessible to everyone, even students who come from low-income
            families and other underprivileged communities. I'm currently running for re-election,
            however, I've also been asked to represent IIT on a larger scale as an Ambassador to the
            Coalition of Chicago Colleges and Universities.  After completing my undergraduate
            studies at Illinois Tech, I hope to pursue a PhD in either Applied Mathematics, Computer
            Science, or a similar field.  My ultimate goal is to teach computer science and
            mathematics as a university professor.
